\section{Heuristic Aligner}

As a heuristic aligner, I chose to score alignments using ratio of counts. Each French word
is aligned to the highest scoring English word. All training data is used as counts scale well.
At first, I tried scoring $S = c(e, f) / (c(e) \cdot c(f))$, but this performed worse than the
baseline aligner. Tweaking the formula to $S = c(e, f) / (c(e) + c(f))$, AER improved to 58.3%
and BLEU improved to 12.421.
