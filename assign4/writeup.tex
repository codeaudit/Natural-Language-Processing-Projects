use best F1


\section{Features}

Using best-list position and rule indicators as simple features, the reranker has 45,991 features,
trains in 110 seconds, and achieves a F1 of 85.43.

I then added the 1-width binned log probability assigned to a tree as an indicator feature.
While Charniak and Johnson used the probability as a feature directly,
Johnson and Ural's used both real probability as well as binned log probability indicators,
and the binned indicators had a greater effect on F1. This may be due to binning probabilities
allows the reranker to accurately learn nonlinear relationships between log probability and tree quality.
